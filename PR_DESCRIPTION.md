# Audio Capture and Error Handling Improvements

## Overview
This PR enhances the audio capture module and implements comprehensive error handling throughout the application. It addresses issues with the `desktopCapturer` API and adds robust error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms.

## Changes

### Audio Capture Improvements
- Fixed the `desktopCapturer` API usage by properly accessing it through the main process
- Implemented a new `AudioCaptureService` with better error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Added support for both desktop and microphone audio capture
- Improved status reporting and logging for audio capture events

### Error Handling Enhancements
- Created a centralized `ErrorHandlingService` for consistent error handling
- Implemented comprehensive logging with Winston
- Added error categorization by type and severity
- Implemented user notifications for errors
- Added fallback mechanisms for critical services

### Text Injection Improvements
- Created a cross-platform `TextInjectionService` for injecting text into active fields
- Implemented platform-specific injection methods (AppleScript, PowerShell, xdotool)
- Added queuing and delay mechanisms for reliable text injection

### Testing
- Added a test script to verify audio capture and speech recognition functionality
- Implemented proper cleanup of resources in test scripts

## Technical Details
- Used IPC communication between main and renderer processes for audio capture
- Implemented singleton pattern for service classes
- Added comprehensive error logging and reporting
- Created fallback mechanisms for critical services
