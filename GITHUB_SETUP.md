4. The PR title should be "Audio Capture and Error Handling Improvements"
5. In the description field, copy and paste the content from the PR_DESCRIPTION.md file
6. Click "Create pull request"

## 4. Review and merge the Pull Request
1. Wait for any CI checks to complete (if configured)

3. If everything looks good, click the "Merge pull request" button
4. Confirm the merge
